# Control System for Electrical Generators: Islanded and Grid-Connected Modes

This project implements a **control system for electrical generators**, focusing on their operation in two distinct scenarios:

- **Islanded mode** – where a generator operates independently  
- **Grid-connected mode** – where the generator functions as part of a larger power network  

The core of the system involves **fine-tuning power and frequency controls** to ensure smooth and stable operation in both modes. The development and simulation are carried out using **OpenModelica**.

Key components include:

- **Techniques for transitioning** between islanded and grid-connected modes, enabling seamless switching  
- Implementation of **optimized tertiary control**, which provides higher-level management and performance optimization for the generator
